Props to [Mehmet Emin Candar](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mehmet-emin-candar-834678232?originalSubdomain=tr),
my brother, for helping me create this blog. Thank you brother! 🙏

Mehmet works as a fullstack software engineer at NETAŞ. He has improved himself in the field
immensely, having worked on some important and challenging projects. He is nowadays working
with Angular and NestJS, frameworks I have never touched (not planning to 😂)

He has been a source of increased motivation for me, and we have been helping each
other with projects. I find the assistance between close people very valuable, and
am thankful for having a brother interested in the same field as me 😄 

## Contributing to others on GitHub
I find myself to be not-so-active in contributing to other people's projects on GitHub, in
direct contrast to my behavior when it comes to helping my brother. I am now planning
to help open source projects by little contributions, so that my helping hand reaches more poeple!
